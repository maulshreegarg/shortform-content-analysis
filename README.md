# Shortform-Content-Analysis
# Data Collection process 
It is a comparative analysis of short-form content by the same creator uploading the same content on YouTube as well as Instagram. The IO scraper tool as well as Apify are used to manually collect data from YouTube shorts. The data collected is authentic, and detailed, and makes sure that the data being used for analysis is not falsified.

# Data preprocessing 
For data preprocessing we first removed all the irrelevant rows that we scraped like urls and id numbers and other columns that were inconsequential to our analysis. 
## Methodology of the project
Steps that are being followed:
1. Scraping short-form content data from YouTube (shorts) and Instagram (reels) for the content creators who post the same content on both platforms for analyzing the performance of their videos.
